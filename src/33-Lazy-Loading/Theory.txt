lazy loading defination : Lazy loading in React means loading components only when required, instead of during the initial page load.

lazy loading uss component pe apply karo joh component pe complex code hai aur zada time le raha hai load hone k liye jiske waje se baki component pe effect hora hai and performance slow kar raha hai

What is Suspense?
When React is loading a lazily loaded component, it doesn't have anything to show immediately. So we wrap it inside a Suspense component to show a fallback UI (like a loading spinner) while the component is being fetched.

lazily loaded component = component jisme lazy loading apply hua hai
