In HTML:
<div style="color: blue; background-color: red;">
  This is a div with inline styles.
</div>


In React:
<div style={{ color: 'red', backgroundColor: 'green' }}>
  React JS Style
</div>


Notes:
Style is passed as a JavaScript object inside JSX.
CSS properties must be written in camelCase.
Use commas, not semicolons, after each property.


How is React inline style different from regular HTML style?
In HTML: style is a string ("color: red;")
In React: style is an object ({ color: 'red' })
Property names use camelCase instead of kebab-case.
Values are in quotes if they are strings.
